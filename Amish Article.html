<p>Cashton, WI — Jacob Miller, an Amish man from Cashton, has made history by becoming the first Amish person in town to drive a car. Traditionally, Amish people use horse-drawn buggies and avoid cars to keep their simple way of life.</p>

<p>Jacob’s decision surprised many in the community. Some Amish neighbors expressed concern, saying cars go against their traditions. “We keep our ways to stay close and simple,” said one neighbor. “Driving a car changes that.”</p>

<p>Others were more open to the idea, believing a car might help Jacob better support his family. “Maybe change can be good sometimes,” said an Amish woman from the area.</p>

<p>Jacob hopes his choice will help his family while still respecting his faith. His decision has sparked important conversations in Cashton about balancing tradition and modern life.</p>
